        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">Duke's "Droplets" Breaks Down Access Barriers And Promotes Splash</h2>

<p>After a running a successful 120-student <a href="http://www.learningu.org/media/emails/march10.html">first Splash</a> last February at Duke University, junior Nancy Yang and others asked themselves how they could improve Splash's attendance and long-term outcomes.<br />
<br />
"We realized that Splash, as a weekend, is a limited opportunity for students," Nancy said, citing limited transportation and lack of knowledge of Splash as roadblocks to attendance.  "We really wanted to spread the concept of innovative education to as many high school students as possible, and give as many Duke students as possible the opportunity to work with high school students."<br />
<br />
Nancy and other Duke Splash leaders developed "Droplets," a program designed to bring Splash classes into Durham-area public schools.  The classes, ranging from improv comedy to bioethics, will give students a taste of what to expect at the Duke University campus on Saturday, February 19, when they run their second-ever Splash.<br />
<br />
Working directly with high schools hasn't been easy, as Nancy notes that local high schools, particularly under-resourced schools are less likely to return calls and e-mails than students or parents.  Despite the challenges, Duke Splash intends to offer "Droplets" several times, giving students the opportunity to choose between four or five sample classes. <br />
<br />
"It's our ultimate goal to provide educational opportunity to everybody," Nancy said.<br />
<br />
Registration for Duke's February 19 Splash program will open soon on their <a href="http://dukesplash.learningu.org">website</a>.</p>

<p>All kinds of discussion has been flying across the Internet about Amy Chua's new book <i>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</i>.  In short, she <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">advocates</a> (excerpt at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>) for a much tougher parenting style.  Be sure to read some of the replies too, at the WSJ, on Google, or this thoughtful <i>New Yorker</i> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2011/01/31/110131crbo_books_kolbert?currentPage=1">piece</a>.<br />
<br />
When you think of educationally top-performing countries, you immediately think of China or Singapore.  But Finland is also a top performer, and <i>The New Republic</i> explains how their education system is <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/82329/education-reform-Finland-US">very different</a>.<br />
<br />
Princeton psychologists say that if information is harder to read, then it's easier to remember!  (Remember that!)  Take a look at their <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman_Oppenheimer_2010.pdf">paper</a>.<br />

Who knew that <a href="http://vihart.com/doodling/">doodles could be mathematical</a>?  Vi Hart shows amazing mathematics (and helps get girls more interested in math, too.)<br />
<br />
This small high school managed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/nyregion/27towns.html">eight Intel semifinalists</a>.  Read about how the school's culture was changed, even though some achievement gaps remain unaffected.</p>
