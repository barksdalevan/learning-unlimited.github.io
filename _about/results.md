# Our Results

Learning Unlimited's programs have reached well over 20,000 students, with an estimated program attendance of over 10,000 for 2013-2014 academic year alone. We continue to shape the way thousands of students look at education.

In addition, approximately 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students taught for a Splash program in the past academic year, providing crucial experience communicating ideas and sharing their passions.

After our programs, we conduct a survey of participants to measure their response to the program.  The results are both informative and motivating.
