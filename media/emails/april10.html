        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">Northwestern Students Hold First Splash</h2>

        <img src="http://www.learningu.org/media/images/emails/apr10/photo.jpg" alt="Northwestern Splash" style="float:left; margin-right:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em;" />

	<p>Over 80 students came to Northwestern University in
	  Evanston, IL on a rainy Saturday to learn how to curl,
	  discuss the philosophical underpinnings of videogames, make
	  an origami chessboard, and learn about biomaterials.  It was
	  the first-ever Splash at Northwestern, held on April 3 and
	  free to all participants through funding from Northwestern
	  and the National Science Foundation.</p>

	<p>Liza Plotnikov, the director of Northwestern Splash,
	  recently graduated from MIT where she had helped direct
	  numerous programs.  Already a veteran of program leadership,
	  Liza made use of Learning Unlimited's web support and
	  teacher training materials.</p>

	<p>In addition, Liza was inspired for the Northwestern program
	  by visiting the University of Chicago's Splash earlier this
	  fall. &quot;I knew that I could never start up something as
	  big at MIT Splash, but by visiting the University of Chicago
	  and by seeing how they ran their program, I thought, 'Hey, I
	  can do this from scratch, too.'&quot;</p>
 
        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">Learning Unlimited Pilots Parent Program at Stanford's Spring Splash</h2>

        <p>On April 17 and 18, Learning Unlimited piloted a parallel
          program at Stanford Splash that was directed towards
          parents.</p>
 
	<p>The program was designed to give useful information for
	families about educational opportunities, college, and
	balancing the pressures of teenage life, while also giving a
	taste of the Splash experience with classes specifically for
	parents on everything from black holes to improvisational
	acting.</p>

	<p>The program's reception was outstanding, with 100% of
	  parents attending saying that they would recommend the
	  program to other parents.  &quot;The speakers are
	  wonderful,&quot; said one parent on a survey.  When asked
	  about the worst parts of the program, &quot;Too short!&quot;
	  said another.  The slides from the first talk on finding
	  additional opportunities for your student, as well as the
	  overall schedule of events, is now available on our
	  website:<br />
          <a href="http://www.learningu.org/parents/">http://www.learningu.org/parents/</a></p>

	<p>In addition, Stanford Splash had a record high attendance,
	with 929 students, up from 650 students earlier this year.
	Stanford Splash also provided free transportation to about 100
	students from underserved high schools.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">University of Chicago Splash hosts Education Conference &quot;Ripple&quot;</h2>
	<p>The students who organize Splash at the University of
	  Chicago gathered over a hundred hundred teachers, community
	  members, students, and leaders in education to discuss the
	  role of creativity in learning as part of an innovative new
	  conference called &quot;Ripple.&quot;</p>

	<p>Featured speakers included MIT professor Sanjoy Mahajan who
	  advocates an approach to teaching math based on estimation
	  instead of rote memorization, Tim King, the founder of the
	  Urban Prep charter school network in Chicago (which had 100%
	  of its students gain acceptance to a four-year college last
	  year), and Tim Knowles, the John Dewey Director of the Urban
	  Education Institute at the University of Chicago.</p>
