  <p><b>Ben Kraft</b>, <i>Chairperson</i><br>
Ben studied math with a side of physics, computer science, and political science at MIT.  In his "spare" time, he co-chaired MIT ESP, represented MIT ESP on the LU Chapter Board, and directed several programs.  Now a software engineer at Khan Academy, he still mentors several LU programs, works on the website used by LU chapters, and teaches math, physics, and gerrymandering at various Splash programs.  When he's not busy learning, teaching, or writing education-related software, he enjoys hiking, folding origami, and making smoothies.

  <p><b>J.D. Zamfirescu</b><br>
  J.D. runs Workshop Weekend, a community-based educational program similar to an all-ages Splash, in Oakland, California. He helped to found Stanford ESP in 2008 and co-founded AppJet, a web collaboration startup, in 2007. AppJet produced a web-based real-time collaborative text editor, EtherPad, which was acquired by Google in 2009. Before moving to San Francisco, he directed programs at MIT ESP and spent a year as a software engineer at Google in New York. J.D. holds both bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from MIT.</p>

   <p><b>Marcus Gomez</b><br>
Marcus is a rising junior at Stanford University studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Electrical Engineering. He serves as the Financial Officer for Stanford Splash and is the co-founder of SplashX, a Coursera-style initiative with content recorded and collected from Splash programs exclusively. He has spent time doing education research at Google, and additionally has experience writing curricula/teaching competitive math to middle and high school students. Marcus’ vision is to make high quality education accessible to every student in the country, equalizing the playing field for everyone with an internet connection. He teaches social psychology courses at Splash, and in his free time enjoys skateboarding, kickboxing, and reading about “dope” machine learning applications.

<p> <b>Rachel Lawrence</b><br>
Rachel graduated from Yale in 2016 with a degree in Applied Mathematics. At Yale, she was involved with Splash as director and organization president, in addition to teaching an abundance of classes on topics ranging from algorithm design to graph theory. After graduating, she went on to work on research software development at Pixar before moving to New York to work as a software engineer at Reservoir Labs, while staying involved with LU and chapter services. When she's not working on Splash, Rachel enjoys digital painting, hiking, and endlessly browsing Wikipedia.</p>

  <p><b>Our Volunteers</b><br>
The Learning Unlimited volunteers are composed of former program leaders working alongside others who never had a chance to run a Splash. Some are still in college, while some have long graduated, but they all help to make our programs a reality. They bring diverse talents, from business
and legal advice to web programming to graphic design, and together form the backbone of our organization.  We invite anyone with interest to join us in volunteering; <a href = "../help/">find out more</a>.</p>
