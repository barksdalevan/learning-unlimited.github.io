        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">From Colombia to Columbia: Big questions and MIT Splash</h2>

<p>Gladys Velez-Calceido's persistent questions brought her from her childhood in Zarzal, a small farming village in northern Colombia, to Columbia University, where she is pursuing an undergraduate degree in astrophysics.  She stopped to take classes in modern physics and astrophysics at several  MIT ESP programs along the way.<br />
<br />
"A lot of what I am currently learning in college I first learned through Splash, Spark, and HSSP at MIT," Gladys said.<br />
<br />
Gladys first heard about the programs when she was living with one of her older sisters in an apartment in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Gladys's parents had died when she was young, and her sister, as her legal guardian, wasn't able to drive her to MIT, so Gladys would spend up to four hours a day commuting to campus on public transportation.  Though Splash was far, it was free.<br />
<br />
"I feel that Splash was very accessible on any budget, and for what it provides&mdash;the people and friends I met, the things I learned and the whole experience&mdash;it was priceless. Had the program been more expensive, I don't think I would have been able to afford it, but Splash offers financial aid which ensures that any student who wants to participate gets the opportunity to do so," she said. <br />
<br />
Gladys is interested in starting a Splash program at Columbia University and Barnard College and has started to work with Chris Kennedy of Learning Unlimited to plan a program for younger students.<br />
<br />
"I want to open this campus up to students who may not otherwise get the experience I did at MIT Splash."</p>
