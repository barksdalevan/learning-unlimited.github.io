<p>Learning Unlimited was one of 19 social impact organizations chosen to receive office space and mentoring from business leaders through the MassChallenge competition.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.masschallenge.org">MassChallenge</a>, which is sponsored by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Microsoft, Xerox, and other organizations, intends to support and sustain startup organizations and entrepreneurs in Massachusetts and around the world.   The organization was cited by President Obama as a model for additional economic growth and job creation.<br />
<br />
"Being chosen as a MassChallenge finalist is an honor for Learning Unlimited," said CEO Daniel Zaharopol.  "Not only will LU continue to benefit from connections within the business community, but also it is a testament to LU’s continued success and its future health."

<p>Last April, Jessica Yen, a senior at San Mateo High School, attended Stanford Splash on the recommendation of a friend.  A year later, Yen was on her way to starting a Splash at her new college, UCLA.<br />
<br />
Yen used LU to help her build a team of college student leaders and as a resource for grant writing, and kept in touch with an LU mentor in the months leading up to Splash.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://splashatucla.learningu.org">Splash at UCLA</a> drew in students from over 15 schools in the Los Angeles area.  Class topics ranged from "How to Become an Animator" to "The Art of Argument."<br />
<br />
Though Yen is familiar with Splash from her high school days, the program still surprises her.  "I didn't expect to see so many students engaged in discussions," she said.

"I have no problem with praising effort. It’s praising intelligence by itself that’s the problem. ... Schools get this exactly wrong. Kids are taught the opposite. They’re told they’re smart. They think this means they should understand everything right away. But they won’t. And at some point they stop doing math," said Josh Zucker, author of <a href="http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/numberplay-danger-of-praise/">these puzzles</a>.<br />
