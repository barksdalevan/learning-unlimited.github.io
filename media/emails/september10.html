With your support, we're putting together programs that maintain the fun, inquisitive, and energetic nature of Splash while providing information relevant to you as a parent.  You'll be able to find our programs at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stanford Splash, November 13-14</li>

<p>With your help, Learning Unlimited has achieved tremendous growth over the past year, its first year of operation.  We've helped found two new Splash programs, developed an intense mentoring program, and maintained the web platforms for student groups across the country.  Find out about everything we've been doing in our <a href="http://www.learningu.org/media/docs/annualreport2010.pdf">annual report</a>.  (Warning: 7mb.)</p>

        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">National Conference for Science and Technology in Out-of-School Time</h2>

<p>Here's an interesting factoid.  Most scientists first became interested in science before middle school, but they found their particular field in high school.  That makes programs like Splash, Cascade, and HSSP perfect for budding scientists: they can explore a number of different areas and find what most interests them.</p>

<p>It's just one of the interesting things we learned last week while attending the National Conference for Science and Technology in Out-of-School Time.  The conference brought together the vibrant community of providers of out-of-school activities for students of all ages with over 200 participants.  Dan Zaharopol, Learning Unlimited's CEO, attended the conference to participate in discussions ranging across policy, research, and practice and to publicize LU's work.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">President's Council Reports on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education</h2>

<p>Making a big splash in the education world was the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology which released their <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pcast">plan for improving STEM education</a>.</p>

<p>The very first recommendation of the report was that we must focus on both "preparation and inspiration." The report also calls for the creation of "opportunities for inspiration" outside the classroom, a call that we are happy to answer with Learning Unlimited programs across the country.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">What We're Reading</h2>

<p>This month's newsletter has already been pretty heavy on the science focus, and now we have one more science education report that came out this month.  The National Science Board released their <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsb1033">report</a> on preparing the next generation of STEM innovators.  It talks at length about how to encourage the best and brightest to live up to their potential.</p>

<p>Are small schools really the key to better education?  This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/education/28school.html">New York Times article</a> provides a counter-example.</p>

<p>Is admission to colleges unfairly slanted towards children of alumni?  Read a review of the book <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/22/legacy">Affirmative Action for the Rich</a>.</p>
