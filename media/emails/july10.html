        <h2 style="color:#7F9FD2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em; clear:both;">Teacher Profile: Annie Considine</h2>

	<div style="float:right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom:0.5em; "><img alt="Annie in a production of 'Hamlet'" src="http://www.learningu.org/media/images/emails/july10/hamlet.jpg" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:inline;" /><p style="font-size: 0.9em;">Annie in a production of <i>Hamlet</i></p></div>

        <p>Annie Considine has always loved Shakespeare and has been
          in countless performances with Shakespeare and Young Company
          and the Dean's Men. When she learned that she could teach
          anything to high school students, the University of Chicago
          sophomore and a Bard-loving friend jumped at the
          opportunity.</p>

        <p>What Annie didn't realize was that her students, many of
          whom came to the University of Chicago's Cascade program
          from under-resourced Chicago Public Schools, would struggle
          with words like &quot;sorrow&quot; and
          &quot;ornament.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;It was very shocking&mdash;they didn't have much of
          a modern vocabulary, much less an archaic vocabulary,&quot;
          Annie said.</p>

        <p>Annie and her co-volunteer teacher quickly rewrote their
          curriculum, relying more on YouTube clips and
          &quot;Elizabethan to English&quot; translations to assist
          with comprehension and analysis.</p>

        <p>Over the course of their five evenings together as a class,
          Annie's students became more comfortable participating in
          discussions and pursued her after class to talk about
          college.</p>

        <p>&quot;Students see us as friends more than any
          schoolteacher could ever be&mdash;they saw someone our age
          teaching and thought that's kind of extraordinary,&quot;
          Annie said.</p>

        <p>Soon, LU will centralize lesson ideas from volunteer
          teachers across its six chapters, so that future volunteer
          teachers who want to teach Shakespeare, for example, can
          anticipate some of their students' gaps in content
          knowledge&mdash;and bring a dictionary with them.</p>

        <p>A report from <i>The Journal of College Admission</i> suggests
          that homeschooled students are more successful in college
          than their non-homeschooled peers.  Read a summary of the
          findings

           how a middle school in Akron, Ohio developed lesson plans
           that engaged students while improving test scores, fighting

           tests.</p>
