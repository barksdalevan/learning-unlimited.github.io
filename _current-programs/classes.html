  <h1>LU Program Classes</h1>
  <p>Classes at LU programs are generally mix of academic and non-academic topics generally not covered in mainstream educational curricula. For example, classes often cover advanced topics in math and physics; hands-on skills like making ice cream using liquid nitrogen; creative expression in hip-hop choreography; and cooking the cuisines of the world.</p>
  
  <h2>Sample Class Descriptions</h2>
  
  <h3>Antarctica: Secrets of a Frozen Land</h3>
  <p>
Ever wonder what it's like at the end of the world? Look no further than Antarctica, the world's coldest, highest, driest, and windiest continent. In this class, we'll explore what makes Antarctica such a unique place, its significance to the global climate, and some of the weird and wonderful creatures that call the Antarctic home - from penguins and seals to giant sea spiders and glass sponges. Plus, see firsthand footage of icebergs and killer whales, and learn how you too can visit the white continent!

  <h3>Pekin Face Painting</h3>
  <p>Students in this class learned about the ancient art of Pekin Face Painting.  This facial make-up is applied to distinguish different roles and reveal their dispositions and moral qualities.  Red stands for courage and loyalty and white represents brutality and cruelty. Students explored intriguing facts about Chinese culture and learned the application of face painting. <em>(Stanford Splash, Fall 2009)</em></p>

  <h3>Unusual Bicycle Design and Construction Techniques</h3>
  <p>Students in this class learned about how to make very unique bikes. After an explanation of different design strategies and construction techniques (cardboard designs, wood designs), the students worked in teams to design their own bikes. These designs were reviewed at the end with ergonomics, integrity, and uniqueness in mind. <em>(Stanford Splash, Fall 2009)</em></p>

  <h3>Imaging Atoms</h3>
  <p>Have you ever wondered how you can image the atomic structure of materials? In this class you will learn how one basic concept of quantum mechanics allowed for the development of a state-of-the-art experimental technique, scanning tunneling microscopy, to do just this. This class will include a demonstration of Clark's newly acquired scanning tunneling microscope.<em>(Clark Splash, Fall 2012)</em> <div class="imagebox floatleft"></div><iframe width="520" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wUsTtoTHwWU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

  <h3>Science-Fiction's Most Important Character: HAL 9000</h3>
  
  <p>Science-fiction fans will enjoy and appreciate this presentation on the movie character that started modern sci-fi: HAL 9000, the psychotic supercomputer from Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I'll explore HAL's enormous influence by showing clips of him and then showing clips from other popular movies that owe their memorable images to the character of HAL. These movies will include The Matrix, the Star Wars trilogy, the Terminator series, WALL-E, I Robot, Blade Runner, and even Peter Jackson's The Lord of The Rings.

  <h3>Giving Nothing Away: Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3>
  
  <p>Suppose that you've just solved one of the biggest problems in mathematics. Naturally, you'll want to jealously guard your secrets…except that you don't want to give anything away until your work is accepted for publication. How can you prove to your friends that your proof is valid…without giving anything away? With the tools of complexity theory, it's known that you can keep your secrets *and* prove your brilliance. Learn how. <em>(MIT Splash, Fall 2009)</em></p>

  
  <h3>Oreo-ases: The Rate of Cookie Catalysis and How It Relates to Disease</h3>
  
  <p>Enzymes, life's chemists, can accelerate the rates of biological processes by up to 20 orders of magnitude over the uncatalyzed reaction. In this exploration, students will become enzymes (oreo-ases), and experiment with how mutations affect the rates of reaction, to gain an intuitive understanding of enzyme kinetics. Also, using HIV protease as the case study, students will explore the atomic level details of how mutations affect the structure of the enzyme, which, in turn, affects the rate at which it can carry out reactions. We will use a molecular viewer (SwissPDB) in this part of the exploration. <em>(Stanford Splash, Fall 2009)</em></p>

  <h3>The Coolest Sports- Ice Sports 101</h3>
  
  <p>Did watching the 2010 Winter Olympic Games inspire you to learn more about the world of ice sports? Were you intrigued by speed skating, curling, figure skating and hockey? Then come learn about these sports in this fun, interactive class. On ice or off, we will be using equipment that ice athletes train with to increase their knowledge of their sport as well as gain more strength, speed and stamina. Learn about the different career options that these sports offer as well as the Paralympics side to the world of ice sports. Comfortable clothing is required because we will be doing some “floor curling” and slide board skating. This will be a cool class! <em>(From Northwestern Splash, Spring 2010)</em></p>
